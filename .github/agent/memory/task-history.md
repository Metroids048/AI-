# Task History

### [TASK-001] Initialize governance, memory, and report-driven agent rules
- **Date**: 2026-06-28
- **Type**: bootstrap
- **Summary**: Created the repository governance layer first, including `AGENTS.md`, memory files, project metadata, and root configuration. The research report was elevated to the canonical architecture source for all future implementation.
- **Files changed**: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/**/*`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `README.md`
- **Notes**: This repository is still in Phase 0. Backend/frontend code should be added only after reading these governance files.

### [TASK-002] Add platform master design package
- **Date**: 2026-06-28
- **Type**: design
- **Summary**: Added the platform master design package as the repository's implementation mother document, including the main design document and three appendices for repository structure, feature phasing, and principles/non-goals.
- **Files changed**: `docs/architecture/platform-master-design.md`, `docs/architecture/appendix-*.md`, `docs/architecture/report-alignment.md`, `.github/agent/memory/*.md`
- **Notes**: The next recommended design step is the domain and interfaces design package.

### [TASK-003] Add domain and interfaces design package
- **Date**: 2026-06-28
- **Type**: design
- **Summary**: Added the domain and interfaces design package, defining the core domain objects, aggregate boundaries, lifecycle states, interface groups, agent I/O objects, and orchestration backbone for the research platform.
- **Files changed**: `docs/architecture/domain-and-interfaces-design.md`, `docs/architecture/platform-master-design.md`, `docs/architecture/report-alignment.md`, `.github/agent/memory/*.md`
- **Notes**: The next recommended design step is the data and ingestion design package.

### [TASK-004] Complete the remaining pre-development design assets
- **Date**: 2026-06-28
- **Type**: design
- **Summary**: Added the remaining pre-development preparation documents, including data and ingestion design, agent and orchestration design, execution/risk/review design, product specification, feature catalog, roadmap, environment/config guide, and delivery checklist.
- **Files changed**: `docs/architecture/*.md`, `docs/product/*.md`, `docs/roadmap/*.md`, `docs/ops/*.md`, `README.md`, `.github/agent/memory/*.md`
- **Notes**: The repository now contains a broad project preparation package. The next step can shift to concrete schema/API/model implementation.
